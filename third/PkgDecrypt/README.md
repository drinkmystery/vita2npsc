# PkgDecrypt
Decrypts and extracts PS Vita PKG files.

# Dependencies
* zlib

# Features
* Fully supports: PSV titles, PSV updates, PSV DLCs (through `/bgdl/` method) and PSM titles, 
* 1:1 file extraction,
* Support for klicensee and zRIF keys for work.bin 1:1 recreation,
* Can either extract PKG or decrypt it into PKGS file,
* Different output hierarchies can be chosen for easy transfer to VITA.

# Usage
```
pkg_dec [--make-dirs=id|ux] [--license=<key>] [--raw] filename.pkg [output_directory]
	--make-dirs=id|ux	Use output directory to create special hierarchy,
				id	places all output in the <CONTENTID> folder
				ux	places all output in ux0-style hierarchy
	--license=<key>		Provide key to use as base for work.bin (*.rif) file creation.
				Two formats accepted - klicensee key (deprecated) and zRIF (recommended)
				zRIF could be made by NoNpDrm fake RIFs using make_key
	--queue-length=<int>	Maximum length of install queue for DLCs to generate, default is 32
	--split			Creates new directory to continue installation queue if limit reached
	--raw			Output fully decrypted PKG instead of unpacking it, exclusive
	<filename.pkg>		Input PKG file
	<output_directory>	Directory where all files will be places. Current directory by default.
```
To create new, zRIF license, use the make_key.

```
make_key [--force] license_file...
	--force		Use to skip the input file validation (and force old behavior)

```


# Requirements
* Windows x64 or x86 (for precompiled builds) or other supported OS,
* VC++ Redist 2017 installed (not needed if using CMake),
* a)Vita with 3.60 henkaku, PKG file and license key[klicensee(deprecated) or zRIF(recommended)] for Vita installation,
* b)PKG file for extraction purposes only.

# Compile

```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
sudo make install # For Linux and Mac
```

# Changelog:
### 1.3.2-1
* make_key now validates input files and refuses to create key if it fails. New flag --force could be used if old behavior desired,
* QoL only release.
### 1.3.2
* Added `--queue-length` parameter to control maximum install queue length for DLCs.
* PSM support bugfix.
### 1.3.1
* Added `pm.dat` generator (required for PSM PKGs).
### 1.3.0
* Corrected directory layout for PSM in "ux" mode,
* Updated make_key to support PSM RIFs.
### 1.2.3
* Fixed bug with macOS build, thanks to @kkaazzee,
* Fixed bug in sfo parser related to string-type fields.
### 1.2.2
* Improvements in DLC unpacking mode,
* Now using command-line tools for windows build,
* Since this version x86 precompiled builds are also available.
### 1.2.1
* Corrects unpacking folder for the game patches in `ux` mode,
* Fixed bug that occured if there was more than 10 DLCs extracted in `/bgdl/t/` directory
### 1.2.0
* Added generation of `PDB` files for DLC package installation.
### 1.1.3
* Fixed bug which prevented creation of `sce_sys/package` directory contents for some PKGs.
* Changed directory layout of `ux` mode for DLC packages.
### 1.1.2
* Fixed bug with PSM PKG unpacking.
### 1.1.1
* Bug fixes.
### 1.1.0
New features:
- Support of generating fake RIFs from hex-encoded klicensee and zRIFs
- Unpacking files using ux0 hierarchy emulation
- Automatic recognition of DLC and GD packages (using pkg_info fields)
- make_key program to pack fake RIFs into zRIF format

Major refactoring of code:
- Split code over few modules, for example, key encoding and decoding done using keyflate.c
- Few utility functions (mkdirs and set of pkg_* functions mirroring stdio with transparent decryption)
- Improved code readability with structs defining various structures in pkg file

Bugfixes:
- Generated head.bin now have proper file size,
- Attempted to fix sku_flag value using drm_type of package (different solution from temp.bin),
- Other bugfixes.
### 1.0.3
* Added full support for license keys, now if you use license key it will generate fully working work.bin file,
* Added check for license, if license is not used, file work.bin will not be generated at all,
* All *.bin files are now generated in proper location `output_folder/sce_sys/packages/*.bin`
### 1.0.2
* Fixed Windows extraction, now it extract 1:1 files.
### 1.0.1
* St4rk's support for *.bin files
### 1.0.0
* St4rk Initial code

# ToDo list:
- [ ]  Found out exactly how body.bin and stat.bin are created,
- [ ]  Add support for VitaShell 1.76 DLC promotion/refresh (instead of `/bgdl/` method), 
- [ ]  Add PSX/PSP contents support to use through adrenaline.
